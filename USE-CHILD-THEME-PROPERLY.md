# Use Child Theme Properly (Best Practice)

## 🎯 Why Use a Child Theme?

**Additional CSS (Customizer):**
- ✅ Survives theme updates
- ✅ Stored in database
- ⚠️ Can get messy with lots of CSS
- ⚠️ Not version controlled

**Child Theme:**
- ✅ Survives parent theme updates
- ✅ Professional & organized
- ✅ Can add functions.php customizations
- ✅ Easy to version control & backup
- ✅ **Best practice for WordPress**
