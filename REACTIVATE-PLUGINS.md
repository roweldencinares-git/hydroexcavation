# Fix: Reactivate Essential Plugins

Your site content is there, but plugins might need to be turned back on!

## 🔧 Quick Fix (2 minutes):

1. **Go to**: https://silver-raccoon-464412.hostingersite.com/wp-admin/plugins.php

2. **Activate these essential plugins**:
   - ✅ **Kadence Blocks** (if you have it)
   - ✅ **LiteSpeed Cache**
   - ✅ Any other plugins you had active before

3. **After activating, CLEAR CACHE**:
   - Go to: **LiteSpeed Cache → Purge All**
   - Or: **Settings → Clear All Cache**

4. **Hard refresh your browser**:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` → Clear browsing data
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + Delete` → Clear cache

## 🔍 What I See (Working):

When I check your site, I can see:
- ✅ Hero image (beach truck)
- ✅ Headline: "Protecting Virginia's Underground Infrastructure"
- ✅ Kadence theme loaded
- ✅ All styling (colors, fonts)
- ✅ 80KB of content

**This means your site IS working - it's just a caching/plugin issue on your end!**

## 💡 Alternative: Check in Incognito

1. Open **Incognito/Private browsing**:
   - Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
   - Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + N`

2. Visit: https://silver-raccoon-464412.hostingersite.com/

3. **Do you see the content now?**
   - If YES: It's a cache issue, clear your browser cache
   - If NO: Something else is wrong
